### "It's not my problem."

That may be true, but that doesn't mean that it's nobody's problem.

What if you could see the faces of all of the people who have stood up and said "I care about this issue. I want to see this fixed. I want to make this go away".

Does knowing that these faces, some of who you recognize, some of whom you may not know but at least you can empathize with, to know that they want to see this problem go away. Does that motivate you to action? To catalyze you into sitting up and paying attention?

That's what they are trying to get you you to do when they march in the streets, or walk around in circles picketing. They just want you to notice them. To take a seconds and look again at what the problem is.

But we propose a more reasonable approach. 

Instead of train got be as obnoxious as possible, trying to force ourselves into your vision, and acting the defensive reactions that try to push us out. Instead we just want to offer ourselves up,. Not in your faec, but there. Persistently. Saying, hey this is what we care about.

Join us, or don't, the choice is up to you. We're over here trying to make a difference. We'd love to have you join us.
