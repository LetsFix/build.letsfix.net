### We all have such busy schedules.

We want to help. We want to do the right thing. But sometimes we just don't have the time.

How much time can we devote to research? Must we follow every piece of news? Are we supposed to look up all the studies? Keep up with every new paper?

And on every last subject we think is important?

We wish we could, but there simply aren't enough hours in the day.

We imagine a simpler alternative. A way to get someone up-to-speed. A collection of the most important points.

And ideas about where to start.
