PowerPoint:

Most people I know want to make the world a better place.

In so many ways the world is incredible — abundant food that strangers readily cook for each other, very easy travel across the planet, magic rectangles that let you talk to each other no matter the distance, or all of our collective knowledge in our pocket, practically for free.

But the world is also not perfect.

For one thing, some of these wonders are not available to most people.

The women in this room, or your mothers, or your sisters, or your daughters, will be paid on average $.73 cents for every dollar a man makes, in the exact same job, with the exact same education. (That's 52% of the world, by the way.)

 1bn [fact check number] people around the world will go to bed hungry tonight.

And access to clean, drinkable water is become more and more of a disaster. [research? **Charity: water**, perhaps].

Our planet faces certain existential threats: do to the possibility of extreme human caused climate change, millions of peoples lives will be at danger, (predominantly in the 3rd world, where they had so little to do with it in the first place).

And all of these conditions are merely the luck of fate. The people affected and the people unaffected are different only because of a roll of a dice of where they were born. For the most part, the people born on the wrong side of the tracks are innocent in this all. 

In certain parts of the world, the people have lost faith in society, and turned to violence. [Syrian Civil War, Ukranian Separatists Shooting down civilian aircrafts, 

And unfortunately, these sentiments are not always so far from home: [pictures of Occupy Wall St, Occupy Oakland, Ferguson MO protests]

And our elected representatives don't exactly have the best track record for staying on top of the issues we care about: [graph of Congressional approval rating over time]. How could they? How could 500 men and women in D.C. possibly have the time to address the issues faced by 300 million Americans. The numbers just don't add up [picture of 1 congressperson (preferably someone incompetent looking) to 600,000 constituents]. 

Sometimes these challenges we face together just feel like all too much. It's practically comical to expect anyone to follow them all, and stay on top of the research. They're *so* large, that it's a real uphill battle to stay informed. To keep in mind what are the most important issues, to us.

So what can we do? We can pretend like we don't face these problems, bury our heads in the sand. Look the other way and hope they take care of themselves.

Or we can address them head on. 

I hate this feeling of "but I'm just one person, I can't so anything about it."

But what if there was a better way?

What if we had a tool *just for* addressing these sorts of problems? The kinds we all face, but it's not exactly clear who's responsible for doing something about it.

If a doctor was examining a patient who was not well, they would begin by trying to figure out what's wrong. ![stethoscope] Likewise, we need to diagnose the problems first.

*Each issue* gets it's own page. ![issue page] 

It's own place to collect and organize what we know: What's the problem? Who's affected? What could be causing it? What are the consequences?

We can pool together everything we know, as we've already done so well for Wikipedia. (Did you know that when printed, the English version alone would be longer than ![2000 full encyclopedia volumes]?! That was done completely by volunteers, in just over a decade. And it's now the 2nd most widely read publication in all of human history!)

But we don't want just another encyclopedia, we want to build a problem solving tool. The most effective way to solve the problems we face together.

And when I think about some of these issues, I hate the feeling of "Am I the only one who cares?" Boy, is that a lonely thought. It's nearly enough to make me want to give up sometimes.

So we might ask: What are the problems people care the most about? And what are the problems *I* care most about?

Let's be able to say, "hey *this* is something that matters. *I* care about this. Let's fix this." ![picture of endorsing issue, and "42 people care about this"].

![picture of "here are the top problems I've said I care about".]

![heres an update notification for one of those problems.]

Then there's another feeling that leaves me so frustrated, one last one I want to talk about: "What can *I* possibly do about it?"

Well we can go a step farther. More than just documenting the problem, we can organize the solutions. Each of the problems has many different possible ways to fix them.  Maybe there are already charities and foundations trying to raise money. Or there are individual changes we can make in our own lives. Or solutions through legislation, if only we could muster the support.

All of these ideas can be attached to a problem, so that we immediately know what our options are.

And to each of these options, we can vote "good idea" / "bad idea", or go into more detail. 

Then we know which are popularly favored, and especially uncontroversial.

Now someone visiting this page for the first time can immediately get up to speed: What's the problem? How many people care? And what can we do about it?

The LetsFix process:
1. Diagnose the problem.
2. Show which problems you care about.
3. Organize possible solutions.

Anyone can do this, even just in their spare time. We no longer need to feel like we would have to dedicate our lives to make a meaningful difference.

We can do this.

We have the opportunity to take responsibility for living in the sort of world we want to live in.

The future is in our hands, if we step up.
