Can the truth be crowd-sourced?

It sounds like a silly question.

This is the premise behind Wikipedia. Truth in numbers. It seems to be working. 

It took a few years to get there, and every now and then you'll hear about faulty entries.

But 99% of the time, it works. 

And that's all volunteer effort.

But this is just encyclopedic knowledge. It's supposed to be objective. No point of view.

Can this same premise be applied to social problems? To make the world a better place?

Isn't this the foundation of democracy? The wisdom of crowds.

Our republic has elected representatives with legislative power. A monopoly on violence. Tax rights and the large budget that comes with it.

Can we apply something similar on internet scale? Not representative democracy. Let each person speak for themselves.

But where is the force? How do we fix anything?

We can make suggestions, and point each other to solutions.

Point towards Kickstarter projects, or Github projects, charity funds, volunteer groups. Instructions to write politicians. Educational info. Mailing lists.

These are just suggestions. Nothing is enforceable.

But it's a start.

It's about organization. Focusing the mass of people to move the needle and get something done.

Give us all a way to organize *around* the issues we feel are important to fix. Let us show what we care about.
