Being able to look at a problem

It makes such a difference to be able to look at a problem.

When you look at a dirty room, you know immediately that something's not right.

When you see blood, your mind immediately thinks: "something wrong, investigate!"

But not all problems are like this.

how to do you see when the public education system is failing its students? Do you run standardized test scores, compare them against averages, and then measure the difference in the two numbers. Does that scream to you that "something's not right" in the same way that blood does?

It requires a certain mental cartography to be able to piece together the puzzle that somethings's not right, to get a clear organized picture about what is the situation. and without that map it's hard to know where to to go.

Letsfix is the blank paper that can become that map. The canvas that sits at the ready to be drawn upon, for all to share among each other.

How much easier it is to solve a problem when you know where you are and what the situation looks like.
