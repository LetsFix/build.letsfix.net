# Tagging Other People

Florian & Noah both joined Facebook when they were tagged in pictures by other people. 

That was fb's most successful growth strategy.

LFx could model something similar:
Tag people for issues. "Who do you think would want to solve this?" Because you care about the issue, & the more people tagged to it, the higher profile it is. The more likely it is to get attention. To be fixed.

Also Andrew Chen article about photo tagging being most effective marketing strategy of all time. Had fwd'd to Josh.
