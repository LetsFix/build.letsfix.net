Dear _______,



Let's write an open-letter. This is a way for us to talk to the community. Something's not right.


Anyone can write a Dear _____, to any of their communities

It's like a blog post, without needing to set up a blog of your own. 

Skip the acquiring a domain, installing software, picking a layout. 

This is about you have something to say, and these people are the ones who need to hear it.


This is where the process can start. If I' talking to someone about the world not being quite right, I can invite them to approach it like this.

Invite them to write a Dear World, or Dear America or what have you. Get those feelings off your chest. And let's do someting! Make a difference.
