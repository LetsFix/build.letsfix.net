### More than just reading yet another depressing piece of news

Do you ever find yourself reading yet another pessimistic news article, describing yet another horrible thing going on in the world?

What do they even expect you to do about it? What could you even do?


--------



Why would you want to Lfx a news article about something terrible? Compared with sharing it on social networks, or via email?


-------


Well you read the article, and you want to do something. That's why you LFx. It's like saying: "I agree this is a problem. I want to know what I can do."

You might also want to share it with your networks. Or maybe not. Maybe this is just depressing, and you don't want to share that bad news.

But you do still want to connect with others who have already heard about it, and want to do something.


-------

And then later, as the problem page grows, there might come a time that you find it is worth sharing with your networks. When it is more clear what the problem is, and more clear what individuals can do, and it would be clearly helpful for more people to know about it.
