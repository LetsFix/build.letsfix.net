Call group chat meetings

It would be awesome to be able to schedule a live chat instant message group session. A week in advanced. Anyone can join via a URL.

As the event is upcoming, advertise it, and get people to confirm if they want to participate.

Bring IRC to the masses. To the non-tech elite.

Need to be able to export chat transcript. Would be nice if could have everyone identify as "John D" with real name, and maybe even little picture icon there. Like people are actually in the room.
