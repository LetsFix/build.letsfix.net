## Build LFx

#### The Problem:

LFx is in active development. Help build it into everything it can be.
LFx is an open-source project. The source code is publicly shared, and contributions are accepted by all. Like Linux, Firefox, Android, which are used by over 9000 users.
LFx is managed by an open-company. Anyone can join, and everyone is welcome.

#### What can we do:

• Technical development. Follow #technical tag on issues. Join this mailing list: lfx-tech@googlegroups.com. No previous programming experience required. Head bug squashers. 
• [Crowdfund] LFx.
• Participate in LFx [discussions]({blog,issues,IRC})
• Write to the creators: what does LFx mean to you? where should we focus?
