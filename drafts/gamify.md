Offer people some sort of badge to show that they are committed to their community.

Some benefits: 
  * as an incentive system to gamify the platform. Goals to work towards for personal reward.
  * to foster and environment of social proof where people openly brag about their contributions to the world. How cool it would  be if it was a common & accepted thing for people to say "I'm interested in improving the world/community." Soemtimes this gets said on a one-off basis, but what if it was ubiquitous, like a signature in all emails.
  * link to spread MTM virally
