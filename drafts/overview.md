MTM

## Why
MTM exists to make the world a better place. By communicating the challenges we all face, we can take the first steps towards stronger and more harmonious communities.

## Problems
I. We don't encourage a place for healthy constructive criticism.
II. People who agree on problems aren't connected.
III. Even when the volition is present, it's not clear what we as individuals can do to address some of our issues.

## Our solution
MTM is a social platform to make the world around us better. 
A good will is the most valuable resource in the worldâ€” MTM is the soil to turn these nutrients into a bountiful garden of fruit.
